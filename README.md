# Logistic_Regression_Character_Recognition
MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits and has been widely used in Machine Learning
related topics, especially in Image Classification. Various machine learning models, such as the Linear Classifiers, SVMs, and Neural Nets have been developed to boost its classification accuracy and reduce its training time. In my project, I designed a logistic regression model using python sklearn library to predict labels for handwritten digits based on 28x28 gray scale images of digits from MNIST. My model consists 10 logistic regressions. Each of them is trained and used to classify a particular kind of digits. For example, the first logistic regression is used to classify digit 0 and others, the second logistic regression is used to classify digit 1, and so on. My model is constructed by using normalization for data preprocessing, L2 regularizer for training, and confusion matrix, training speed, and classification accuracy for evaluation. I showed my proposed model performance well in training speed and achieves a 91.51% accuracy.
